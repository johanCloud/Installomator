# This fork by Søren Theilgaard (@theilgaard)
# -  Mostly to implement version checking before demanding app to close,
#    but also to separate the labels in a separate file,
#    and have this script installed for MDM calls.
# -  Not recommended for use in Jamf Pro.
# -  Testet with Mosyle Business and Manager MDMs.
# -  Testet with Addigy MDM.

# NOTE: adjust these variables:

# set to 0 for production, 1 for debugging
# while debugging, items will be downloaded to the parent directory of this script
# also no actual installation will be performed
DEBUG=0


# notify behavior
NOTIFY=success
# options:
#   - success      notify the user on success
#   - silent       no notifications
#   - all          all notifications (great for Self Service installation)


# behavior when blocking processes are found
BLOCKING_PROCESS_ACTION=tell_user
# options:
#   - ignore       continue even when blocking processes are found
#   - quit         app will be told to quit nicely, if running
#   - quit_kill    told to quit twice, then it will be killed
#                  Could be great for service apps, if they do not respawn
#   - silent_fail  exit script without prompt or installation
#   - prompt_user  show a user dialog for each blocking process found
#                  abort after three attempts to quit
#                  (only if user accepts to quit the apps, otherwise
#                  the update is cancelled).
#   - prompt_user_then_kill
#                  show a user dialog for each blocking process found,
#                  attempt to quit two times, kill the process finally
#   - prompt_user_loop
#                  Like prompt-user, but clicking "Not Now", will just wait an hour,
#                  and then it will ask again.
#                  WARNING! It might block the MDM agent on the machine, as
#                  the scripts gets stuct in waiting until the hour has passed,
#                  possibly blocking for other management actions in this time.
#   - tell_user    User will be showed a notification about the important update,
#                  but user is only allowed to quit and continue, and then we
#                  ask the app to quit.
#   - tell_user_then_kill
#                  Show dialog 2 times, and if the quitting fails, the
#                  blocking processes will be killed.
#   - kill         kill process without prompting or giving the user a chance to save


# logo-icon used in dialog boxes if app is blocking
LOGO=appstore
# options:
#   - appstore      Icon is Apple App Store (default)
#   - jamf          JAMF Pro
#   - mosyleb       Mosyle Business
#   - mosylem       Mosyle Manager (Education)
#   - addigy        Addigy
# path can also be set in the command call, and if file exists, it will be used.
# Like 'LOGO="/System/Applications/App\ Store.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns"'
# (spaces have to be escaped).


# App Store apps handling
IGNORE_APP_STORE_APPS=no
# options:
#  - no            If installed app is from App Store (which include VPP installed apps)
#                  it will not be touched, no matter it's version (default)
#  - yes           Replace App Store (and VPP) version of app and handle future
#                  updates using Installomator, even if latest version.
#                  Shouldn’t give any problems for the user in most cases.
#                  Known bad example: Slack will loose all settings.


# install behavior
INSTALL=""
# options:
#  -               When not set, software will only be installed
#                  if it is newer/different in version
#  - force         Install even if it’s the same version


# Re-opening of closed app
REOPEN="yes"
# options:
#  - yes           App wil be reopened if it was closed
#  - no            App not reopened


# NOTE: How labels work

# Each workflow label needs to be listed in the case statement below.
# for each label these variables can be set:
#
# - name: (required)
#   Name of the installed app.
#   This is used to derive many of the other variables.
#
# - type: (required)
#   The type of the installation. Possible values:
#     - dmg
#     - pkg
#     - zip
#     - tbz
#     - pkgInDmg
#     - pkgInZip
#     - appInDmgInZip
#     - updateronly     This last one is for labels that should only run an updateTool (see below)
#
# - packageID: (optional)
#   The package ID of a pkg
#   If given, will be used to find version of installed software, instead of searching for an app.
#   Usefull if a pkg does not install an app.
#   See label installomator_st
#
# - downloadURL: (required)
#   URL to download the dmg.
#   Can be generated with a series of commands (see BBEdit for an example).
#
# - appNewVersion: (optional)
#   Version of the downloaded software.
#   If given, it will be compared to installed version, to see if download is different.
#   It does not check for newer or not, only different.
#
# - versionKey: (optional)
#   How we get version number from app. Possible values:
#     - CFBundleShortVersionString
#     - CFBundleVersion
#   Not all software titles uses fields the same. 
#   See Opera label.
#
# - appCustomVersion(){}: (optional function)
#   This function can be added to your label, if a specific custom
#   mechanism hs to be used for getting the installed version.
#   See labels zulujdk11, zulujdk13, zulujdk15
#
# - expectedTeamID: (required)
#   10-digit developer team ID.
#   Obtain the team ID by running:
#
#   - Applications (in dmgs or zips)
#     spctl -a -vv /Applications/BBEdit.app
#
#   - Pkgs
#     spctl -a -vv -t install ~/Downloads/desktoppr-0.2.pkg
#
#   The team ID is the ten-digit ID at the end of the line starting with 'origin='
#
# - archiveName: (optional)
#   The name of the downloaded file.
#   When not given the archiveName is derived from the $name.
#
# - appName: (optional)
#   File name of the app bundle in the dmg to verify and copy (include .app).
#   When not given, the appName is derived from the $name.
#
# - targetDir: (optional)
#   dmg or zip:
#     Applications will be copied to this directory.
#     Default value is '/Applications' for dmg and zip installations.
#   pkg:
#     targetDir is used as the install-location. Default is '/'.
#
# - blockingProcesses: (optional)
#   Array of process names that will block the installation or update.
#   If no blockingProcesses array is given the default will be:
#     blockingProcesses=( $name )
#   When a package contains multiple applications, _all_ should be listed, e.g:
#     blockingProcesses=( "Keynote" "Pages" "Numbers" )
#   When a workflow has no blocking processes, use
#     blockingProcesses=( NONE )
#
# - pkgName: (optional, only used for pkgInDmg, dmgInZip, and appInDmgInZip)
#   File name of the pkg/dmg file _inside_ the dmg or zip
#   When not given the pkgName is derived from the $name
#
# - updateTool:
# - updateToolArguments:
#   When Installomator detects an existing installation of the application,
#   and the updateTool variable is set
#      $updateTool $updateArguments
#   Will be run instead of of downloading and installing a complete new version.
#   Use this when the updateTool does differential and optimized downloads.
#   e.g. msupdate
#
# - updateToolRunAsCurrentUser:
#   When this variable is set (any value), $updateTool will be run as the current user.
